        <h3>Why Should I Join?</h3>
        <p>
          Members of FCCLA get to participate in activities to increase their leadership skills in the classroom and beyond. STAR Events and Individual Programs provide students to explore their passions and help those around them. Conferences give opportunities to network and make friends across your region, state, and even the nation.

        <h3>Meetings </h3>
        <p>
          We have full chapter meetings on the last Wednesday or Thursday of every month. Attendance is not required but it is suggested. If you are a STAR Events competitor, then there are required meetings on Wednesday and Thursday mornings every week. You are only required to go to one a week.

        <h3>Bulletin Board </h3>
        <p>Our membership officers and committee members decorate a bulletin board with the current theme of the next chapter meeting along with any information about activities that we are planning.

        <h3>Social Media </h3>
        <p>Announcements for meetings and activities are placed on our <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/yettefccla?igsh=
          MXFuMWI1YWpzcXgwbw%3D%3D&utm_-source=qr" target= "_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/@yettefccla?_r=1&_t=ZP-931IJExCFyB" target= "_blank">TikTok</a> pages each month, spreading the word and inviting others to join in.

        <h3> Collaborations With Other Clubs </h3>
        <p>This year we have worked with DECA, National Beta Club, and the National Honor Society on community service projects. This makes us more visible as a club and shows others who are already interested in helping their community what they could do in FCCLA.

            <p>
            Every year our school does an eighth grade open house. Our chapter joins in with a booth in the clubs section to introduce Lafayette FCCLA to incoming freshmen.

        <h3>Activities and Games </h3>
        <p>
          As an FCCLA member you do a lot of work, but you also have a lot of fun. For every meeting the officer team creates a game, competition, or activity for members to participate in. We had a Spooky Cookie Decorating Contest in October, made hand turkeys in November, and planned a holiday movie night in December.

            <h3>Punch Card </h3>
            <p>
            Being in FCCLA is its own reward, but who doesn’t want more? Members who attend full chapter meetings, STAR Event meetings, or other chapter hosted events will gain a hole in their punch card. The member with the most will win a gift card at the end of the school year.

          Our members accomplish amazing things and they deserve to be recognized for their hard work. As a chapter, we are planning to honor a different member each month, showcasing their talents on our <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/yettefccla?igsh=
