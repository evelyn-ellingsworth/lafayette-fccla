      <h2>Why Should I Join?</h2>
      <p>
        Members of FCCLA get to participate in activities to increase their leadership skills, in the classroom and beyond. STAR Events and Individual Programs provide students to explore their passions and help those around them. And conferences give opportunities to network and make friends across your region, state, and even the nation.

      <h3> Collaborations With Other Clubs:</h3>
      <p>This year we have worked with several other clubs on community service projects. This makes us more visible as a club and shows others who are already interested in helping their community what they could do in FCCLA.

      <p>A week before any meeting, the membership committee posts flyers around the school inviting people to come and see what Lafayette FCCLA is all about.

      <h2>Retain and Recognize:</h2>
      <h3>Activities and Games:</h3>
      <p>
        As an FCCLA member you do a lot of work, but you also have a lot of fun. For every meeting the officer team creates a game, competition, or activity for members to participate in. We had a Spooky Cookie Decorating Contest in October, made hand turkeys in November, and planned a holiday movie night in December
      </p>
      <h3>Punch Card:</h3>
      <p>
        Being in FCCLA is its own reward, but who doesn’t want more? Members who attend full chapter meetings, STAR Event meetings, or other chapter hosted events will gain a hole in their punch card. The member with the most will win a gift card at the end of the school year.
      </p>
      <h3>Social Media:</h3>
      <p>
        Our members accomplish amazing things and they deserve to be recognized for their hard work. As a chapter, we are planning to honor a different member each month, showcasing their talents on our social media.
